 -- Introduction --
Hi, my name is Tin!
I decided to journey on an adventure to learn programming. Prior to this I had very little programming knowledge and essentially haven't touched it for years. I played with MySQL databases for a bit but nothing too serious. To begin with, since I have no idea what I want to specify in at the given moment as I just find the idea of creating things interesting and inspiring, I picked up Python. Apart from suggestions from multiple sources over the internet, I found its syntax easy to read and understand which I believe is helpful when tackling on something new sort to speak. I am still at the beginning of my journey and this is a first project I decided to do. As mentioned, prior to this my knowledge of programming was very basic. After finishing Part I of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, instead of following guided projects, I decided it would probably the best to try to think of projects on my own in order to understanding the whole process behind building something. I am sure I will face some challenges but I believe that is the fun part!

-- Short backstory behind the project --
Although this is just a beginning and I might revisit the project in the future, for this stage of my learnnig journey I've decided to build a simple number guessing game. Originally it was just suppose to be the game I can run on my local machine but I've built it within one hour (ngg_v01.py) and wasn't satisfied. I felt the need to implement some features to make this something I will be proud of as my first time building something from scratch. So, I sat down, thought what features i want to have included in the game which I can realistically build with the understanding I have now. In the following text you can read about project information.

-- Project name --
Number Guessing Game

-- Technical information -- 

This project is written in Python 3.12.1. If you want to run the project locally, you will need to install Python. 
Python installer: https://www.python.org/downloads/

-- Project purpose --
The key takeaway is to understand basic concepts of data types and data structures and how they work in a program together. Along the way I hope to gain a better understanding of how to approach problem solving using code. I also want to learn how to test my code properly and how to create tests so I set a goal to use pytest library for doing so. And lastly, I want to learn how to use the git version control system for the future projects.

-- Project features --
I am building a number guessing game in which a player has to guess a number between 1 and 100. As a personal goal this is a set of features I am to implement in my game:

- 1. Number generator
    Create a random number generator.
- 2. User input
    Create a way to allow users to keep guessing until the winning number is guessed. 
- 3. Score system
    I want to create a score system. I came to this idea mostly with the wish that down the line I would host the game on a webpage for others to play. Score will be tracked which should prompt users to play.
- 4. Leaderboards
    In order to make sense of the scoring system I will need to create leaderboards which will need to store user data, compare user data and sort it accordingly. I believe this will be the biggest challenge in the project as I only have a vague idea how to tackle this issue.


Since this is my first project, any advice on both the coding or git is welcomed. Especially regarding documentation.

Thank you for visiting this repo and I hope you have a great day!
